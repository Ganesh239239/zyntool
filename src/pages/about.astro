                <h3>Our Mission</h3>
                <p>ZynTool was created to provide a fast, secure, and free alternative to expensive image editing software. We believe that privacy is a right, which is why your images never leave your computer.</p>
                
                <h3 class="mt-4">How it works</h3>
                <p>We use modern browser technologies (WebAssembly and Canvas) to edit your images locally. This means no waiting for server uploads and 100% security for your data.</p>
