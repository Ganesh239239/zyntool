### How to convert JPG to other formats:

- **100% Secure & Private:** We prioritize your security. Unlike other online converters, your images are **never uploaded to a server**. All conversion logic happens locally on your device, ensuring your data stays 100% private.
- **Zero Quality Loss:** Our professional conversion engine ensures that the integrity of your original photo is preserved, giving you the best possible output every time.
- **No Limits, No Watermarks:** Convert as many images as you want. We never add annoying watermarks or require a paid subscription to access professional features.

### When should you convert from JPG?
- **JPG to PNG:** Use this when you plan to edit the image further. PNG is a "lossless" format, meaning it won't lose quality every time you save it, unlike JPG.
- **JPG to WebP:** This is the "Pro Choice" for web developers. WebP images are often 30% smaller than JPEGs, which makes your website load much faster for users.
- **JPG to GIF:** Ideal for extracting a static frame from a photo to use in simple web graphics or legacy applications.

### Pro Tip for Web Developers:
If you are building a modern website, convert your JPG assets to **WebP**. Google’s Chrome and other modern browsers prioritize WebP for speed, and using this format is a direct way to improve your **PageSpeed Insights** score and overall SEO performance.
