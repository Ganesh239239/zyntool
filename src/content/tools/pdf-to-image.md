## The Best Way to Convert PDF to Image Online
Do you need to extract a specific page from a PDF as a photo? ZynTool allows you to convert entire PDF documents into individual **JPG or PNG** files. Whether you are dealing with a single-page flyer or a 50-page report, our engine handles it in seconds.

### Why convert PDF to JPG?
- **Social Media:** PDFs cannot be posted on Instagram or Facebook. Converting them to JPG allows you to share your documents as photos.
- **Easy Editing:** Extracted images are easier to crop or annotate in standard photo editors.
- **Better Compatibility:** JPGs open on every device without needing a PDF reader.

### How it works:
1. **Select File:** Upload your PDF from your computer or mobile device.
2. **Choose Format:** Select JPG for smaller file sizes or PNG for the highest possible quality.
3. **Download:** Save all pages as a collection of images.
