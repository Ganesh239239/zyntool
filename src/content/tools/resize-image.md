## Professional Image Resizing Tool
Need to fit a photo into a specific space? Our resizer allows you to define exact **Width and Height** or simply scale the whole image down by a percentage (25%, 50%, 75%).

### Maintain Aspect Ratio
Our "Smart Ratio Lock" ensures your photos never look stretched. When you change the width, we automatically calculate the height to keep your image looking perfect.

### Common Image Sizes:
- **Instagram Post:** 1080 x 1080 px
- **YouTube Thumbnail:** 1280 x 720 px
- **Facebook Cover:** 851 x 315 px
