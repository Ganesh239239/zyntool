## Fix Your Photo Orientation Instantly
Did you take a photo that ended up sideways? Or maybe you need to mirror a selfie? ZynTool’s **Rotate IMAGE** tool is a simple but powerful way to get your pictures looking exactly right. With just one click, you can rotate any JPG, PNG, or WebP image to the correct orientation.

### How to rotate or flip images online:
1. **Upload Your Image:** Drag and drop your photo or select it from your computer or smartphone.
2. **Rotate or Flip:** Use the intuitive buttons to rotate 90 degrees right or left. You can also **Flip Horizontally** to mirror the image or **Flip Vertically**.
3. **Preview Changes:** See the orientation update in real-time within our professional workspace.
4. **Download:** Save your perfectly oriented image instantly.

### Why use ZynTool to rotate photos?
- **Mirroring Support:** Perfect for fixing front-camera selfies that look backwards. Use the "Flip Horizontal" feature to mirror your image back to normal.
- **Privacy Guaranteed:** Just like all our tools, your images are processed locally in your browser. We never upload your files to our servers, keeping your personal photos 100% private.
- **Zero Quality Loss:** Our rotation engine preserves every pixel of your original photo, ensuring no loss in resolution or clarity.
- **Works on All Devices:** Whether you are on an iPhone, Android, Mac, or Windows PC, you can fix your photos on the go.

### Fix Landscape and Portrait Issues
Sometimes cameras don't detect the "Gravity" correctly, resulting in landscape photos appearing in portrait mode. Instead of using complex software like Photoshop, ZynTool lets you fix these orientation tags in seconds using our lightweight web engine.

### Pro Tip for Photographers:
If you have a batch of photos taken at the same wrong angle, you can use ZynTool to quickly toggle through them and fix them all before uploading them to your blog or social media.
