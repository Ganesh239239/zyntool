## Render HTML and CSS into Beautiful Images
Need to share a piece of code on LinkedIn or Twitter but want it to look professional? ZynTool’s **HTML to IMAGE** converter allows you to paste raw code and transform it into a crisp, high-quality image file. Our engine handles complex CSS3 styles, gradients, and layouts perfectly, giving you a professional snapshot in seconds.

### How to convert HTML code to an image:
1. **Paste Your Code:** Enter your HTML and inline CSS into our professional code editor box.
2. **Preview Instantly:** Click "Preview" to see exactly how your code will look when rendered.
3. **Select Format:** Choose **PNG** if you need a transparent background or **JPG** for a standard web-friendly file.
4. **Capture and Download:** Get your high-resolution image ready for sharing.

### Why developers choose ZynTool:
- **High-DPI Rendering:** Our tool captures images at **2x resolution (Retina quality)**, ensuring your text and code stay sharp even on high-resolution screens.
- **Privacy First:** Unlike other cloud-based renderers, we process your code locally in your browser. Your data and proprietary code snippets are never sent to a server.
- **Complete CSS Support:** From Flexbox and Grid to Google Fonts and CSS animations—if the browser can render it, ZynTool can capture it.
- **Perfect for Social Media:** Skip the ugly screenshots. Create consistent, branded snapshots of your work for your portfolio or social feeds.

### Best Use Cases:
- **Social Media Snippets:** Share beautiful CSS tricks or JavaScript logic on platforms like Instagram and X.
- **Documentation:** Create consistent image assets for your README.md files or technical blogs.
- **Email Newsletters:** Capture HTML layouts as images to ensure they look perfect in every inbox.
- **UI Design Previews:** Quickly turn a small component design into a shareable PNG for feedback.

### Pro Tip for Better Snaps:
To make your code look its best, wrap your code in a `<div>` with a nice **background gradient** and **padding**. This gives your image a "premium" feel that stands out in social media feeds.

**Example Style:**
`<div style="background: linear-gradient(45deg, #00c6ff, #0072ff); padding: 40px; border-radius: 20px; font-family: 'Courier New'; color: white;">`
