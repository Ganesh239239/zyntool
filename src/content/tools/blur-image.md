## Protect Your Privacy by Blurring Sensitive Info
Need to hide a face in a photo? Or maybe you need to censor a license plate or a private document before posting it on social media? ZynTool’s **Blur IMAGE** tool is designed to give you total control over what people see. Our professional-grade Gaussian blur engine ensures that your sensitive data remains hidden and unreadable.

### How to blur images online:
1. **Upload Your Image:** Drag and drop your JPG, PNG, or WebP file into the secure uploader.
2. **Adjust Intensity:** Use our smooth slider to choose exactly how much blur you need. From a subtle artistic blur to total censorship.
3. **Real-Time Preview:** Watch the image transform instantly as you move the slider.
4. **Download:** Save your protected image directly to your device.

### Why use ZynTool for image censoring?
- **100% Private & Local:** Unlike other online editors, ZynTool doesn't send your images to a server. All blurring happens directly in your browser. This is critical for sensitive documents like IDs, bank statements, or private photos.
- **Adjustable Blur Strength:** Not all censorship needs the same level of blur. Our tool lets you find the perfect balance between hiding details and keeping the photo looking professional.
- **Fast and Lightweight:** No heavy software like Photoshop required. Our tool loads in milliseconds and works on any device.
- **No Watermarks:** We believe privacy shouldn't come with a price or a logo. Your censored images are 100% clean and watermark-free.

### Common Use Cases for Blurring:
- **Faces:** Protect the identity of people in group shots.
- **Personal Data:** Censor addresses, phone numbers, or credit card info on screenshots.
- **License Plates:** Hide car registrations for automotive sales or social media.
- **Backgrounds:** Create a "depth of field" effect to make your main subject stand out.

### Pro Tip for Maximum Security:
If you are censoring highly sensitive text (like a password), set the **Blur Intensity** to at least **20px**. This ensures that even advanced "de-blurring" software cannot recover the original text, keeping your data completely safe.
